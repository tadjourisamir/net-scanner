# 🔌 Net-Scanner

A simple command-line tool to scan a range of IP addresses and identify which hosts are online (reachable via ping).

## 🚀 Purpose

This project helps me apply what I'm learning in networking (CCNA), while also practicing basic Python scripting.  
It's designed to be a lightweight, functional tool for local network diagnostics.

- Ping each IP to check if the host is up
- Display online/offline status
- (Optional) Export results to a file (JSON or TXT)

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies

- Python 3.x
- Standard libraries: `subprocess`, `ipaddress`
- CLI-based, cross-platform (Linux, Windows, macOS)

---

## 🧠 Skills Practiced

- Networking fundamentals
- Python scripting & automation
- IP addressing & ranges
- Command-line application structure
